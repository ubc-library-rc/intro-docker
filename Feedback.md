### What worked:

- Great "going further" bibliography.
- Course materials website
- There is a website containing the material we viewed during the session.
- Slides and resources and clear communication 
- Thorough explanation of complex concepts, that previously confused me

### What did not work:

- Quick installation demo. Installation exercise might not be ideal as in class, but you can do a demo on your system
- The demo went way too fast, and the instructor went through everything too fast for me to catch up, with very little explanation of what was going on.
- would like to see a "live demo" of the docker app - i thought I understood what was being said, but upon opening the app I was completely unsure what to do
- Add another workshop with learning activities using Docker
