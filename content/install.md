# How can you start using Docker?

Beyond exploring [Docker Hub's Playground](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) in the browser environment, the next easiest step for Mac and Windows user is installing Docker Desktop for your operating system. 

On both operating systems, for the purposes of our workshop attendees, it is best to choose **Stable** versions of Docker Desktop over **Edge** versions, which are better suited to experienced developers.

### Docker Desktop for Windows

[Here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) you'll find the installation guide for Windows. 

### Docker Desktop for Mac

[Here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) you'll find the installation guide for Mac. 

Basic installation requirements for Mac include a *build year of 2010 or newer*, *macOS version 10.13 or newer*, and *at least 4 gb of RAM*.

Keep in mind that there are multiple pathways to install and interact with Docker on Mac, and as the install page flags early, some of these may conflict with one another.

Check out, for example, how [Docker Desktop compares with Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/docker-toolbox/) on Mac.

Docker Desktop also provides further documentation on [how to get started on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) after installation, as well as a dedicated [troubleshooting page for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/troubleshoot/).
