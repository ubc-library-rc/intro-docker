# Origins of containerization

Docker itself is incredibly "young," as it was first launched to the open source development community in 2013. However, containers pre-date Docker as a norm for isolating environments in Linux. 

While Docker built upon the pre-established Linux concepts surrounding containers and virtualization, the platform's persistent centralization of related tooling began to deeply impact technology deployment norms. 

Now, instead of learning all the low-level minutia of customizing containers in Linux, developers just needed to get Docker running, and they could create Docker containers from a number of different interfaces.

# Virtualization concepts
This section will introduce a few concepts and terms for you to be aware of before we dive into the specifics of Docker.

### Virtualization in computing

### Virtual machines (VMs)

Virtual Machines (VMs) virtualize the entire "tech stack" of a computer, down to the hardware. They're a lot more resource-intensive than containers but can be necessary for certain computing tasks.
