### Goal of this workshop

Our goal is to understand what Docker is at a higher level, what it's useful for in both tech and academia, and how to dive deeper and install the necessary tooling. 

You will not be an expert by the end of the class. You may not feel totally comfortable using Docker â€“ this is okay. We want to make a start but, as with any skill, using Docker or other containerization tools takes practice.

This is your session. If you have a question or feel we are going too fast, please let the instructor know. We can decide as a group what to cover.
