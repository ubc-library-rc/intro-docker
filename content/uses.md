# What is Docker useful for?

Docker has a number of useful qualities which apply across all industries and applications:

* **"things just work"** - once you've covered the initial learning curve for virtual containers, the process of interacting with them stays consistent
* **no more struggling for dependencies** - you can include all libraries, packages, and dependencies that a piece of software or a dataset needs in an accompanying Docker image, so it will work 'right out of the box' for its recipient

### For academics

* Reproducible computing

### For developer operations



### For programmers
