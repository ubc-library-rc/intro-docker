# Hands-on learning activities

Getting started with Docker can be a bit ironic- Even though mastering Docker can help you solve the many environment and dependency issues you'll come across in computing, getting Docker initially running on any given system can be quite a challenging task at times!

In the interest of time, we'll be exploring a few different browser-based implementations of Docker containers instead of doing a live install, but we welcome you to reach out for a follow-up appointment if you need one-on-one troubleshooting.
