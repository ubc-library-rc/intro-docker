# Introduction to Docker

This workshop is meant to introduce you to the set of virtualization tools referred to as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), which allow you to use, create, and share container images. 

[Containers](https://www.cio.com/article/2924995/what-are-containers-and-why-do-you-need-them.html) create small reproducible computing workspaces on your computer, to which you can ascribe specific libraries and constraints to replicate specific environments.

We'll first discuss the larger concepts from the computing virtualization space, disambiguate the many interrelated components of the Docker ecosystem, and explore some use cases demonstrating the value of containers in both tech and academia. 

Then we'll walk through an overview of install pathways for different operating systems and intended uses, touching on some general troubleshooting points and the cognitive competencies cultivated by dev ops tools like these. 

Finally we'll undertake some [browser-based learning activities](activity.md) to explore the nuts and bolts of Docker images without getting bogged down with installation.

#### Prerequisites

- **TODO: discuss w/ Eka and Liam**
- *Optional*: Sign up for a free Docker ID on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/signup/) so you can check out [their "playground"](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) during the workshop.
- Some experience working with code syntax and code editors, especially [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) is helpful.

In order to seamlessly run Docker images and create containers on your computer, you may need to walk through the installation process more than once. This workshop is intended to equip you with the tools to pursue a local install on your own.
